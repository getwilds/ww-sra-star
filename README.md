[![Project Status: Experimental â€“ Useable, some support, not open to feedback, unstable API.](https://getwilds.org/badges/badges/experimental.svg)](https://getwilds.org/badges/#experimental)

This WILDS WDL workflow downloads paired FASTQs from [SRA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) and aligns them using the [two-pass methodology](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR/blob/master/doc/STARmanual.pdf) of [STAR](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR). It is intended to be a relatively simplistic demonstration of an RNA sequencing pipeline within the context of the WILDS ecosystem.

# Usage

For Fred Hutch users that are new to WDL, we recommend using [PROOF](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/dasldemos/proof-how-to/) to submit these workflows directly to the on-premise HPC cluster, as it simplifies interaction with Cromwell and provides a user-friendly front-end for job submission and tracking. For users outside of Fred Hutch or more advanced users who who would like to run the workflow locally, command line execution is relatively straightforward: 
```
java -jar cromwell-86.jar run ww-sra-star.wdl --inputs ww-sra-star-inputs.json
```
Although Cromwell is demonstrated here, this pipeline is not specific to Cromwell and can be run using whichever WDL execution method you prefer ([miniwdl](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/miniwdl), [Terra](https://terra.bio/), [HealthOmics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/omics/latest/dev/workflows.html), etc.).
